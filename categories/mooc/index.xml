      <description>deeplearning.aiOver the next few days, I’ll go over (this time I am paying and thus have access to the exams :)) the deeplearning.ai Coursera Specialization. Here, I’ll gather my notes of the course for easy access:
Neural Networks and Deep LearningImproving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization.Structuring Machine Learning Projects.Convolutional Neural Networks.Sequence Models.Why?I have already used DL in a couple of personal projects.</description>
