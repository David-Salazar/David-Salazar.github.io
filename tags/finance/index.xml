      <description>The moody Mr. Market Anybody who has even a dime on the stock market will eventually get dragged on following the daily (or even hourly) moves in the market. However, this is not only a stressful idea, but also a very ineffective one. Most days in the market won’t even bulge your final total return. In fact, final market return is mostly determined by a handful of days alone.
Let’s prove this by comparing the annualized return one would get from investing the last 20 years and being invested 100% of the time, and missing the best days of the market due to bad timing.</description>
