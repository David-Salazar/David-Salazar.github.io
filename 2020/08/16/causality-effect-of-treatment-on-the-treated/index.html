<h2>Why read this?</h2>
<p>Regret about our actions stems from a <a href="https://david-salazar.github.io/2020/08/10/causality-counterfactuals-clash-of-worlds/"><strong>counterfactual question</strong></a>: <em>What if I had acted differently?</em>. Therefore, to answer such question, we need a more elaborate language than the one we need to answer prediction or intervention questions. Why? Because we need to compare <strong>what happened</strong> with <em>what would had happened</em> if we <strong>had acted differently</strong>. We need to compute the <strong>Effect of Treatment on the Treated (ETT)</strong>.</p>
<p>To compute the ETT, we need to formulate a Structural Causal Model and leverage the <strong>invariant qualities</strong> across the <em>observed world and the hypothetical</em> world: the unobserved background variables. Indeed, the definition of the Effect of Treatment on the Treated (ETT) is defined for a binary treatment thus:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E[Y_1 - Y_0 | X = 1] \\
= \sum_u [P(y_1 | x_1, u) - P(y_1 | x_0, u)] P(u |x_1)
\]</span></p>
<p>Of course, we don’t have access to the background variables. In this post, we will learn to answer two questions: <strong>when is the ETT identifiable?</strong> And if so, can we give an <strong>estimator</strong> for such counterfactual <em>in terms of non-experimental data</em>?</p>
<p>We will first study a binary treatment and answer both questions. Then, we will tackle the more general case of any treatment.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-motivating-binary-example" class="section level2">
<h2>A Motivating binary example</h2>
<p>The following example is taken from Pearl’s (et alter) book <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/">Causal Inference in Statistics: A primer</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine an average adolescent: Joe. He has started smoking ever since he began High School. Should he regret his decision? That is, given that he has started smoking, has he significantly increased his chances of suffering from lung cancer compared to his chances had he never begun in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, what Joe cares about is the <strong>Effect of Treatment on the Treated</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(E[Cancer_1 - Cancer_0 | Smoking = 1]\)</span>. If ETT &gt; 0, having smoked has caused a higher chance of lung cancer for Joe compared to the hypothetical world where he had never smoked in the first place. How can we calculate the ETT?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E T T &amp;=E\left[Y_{x}-Y_{x^{\prime}} \mid X=x\right] \\
&amp;=E[Y_x \mid X=x]-E\left[Y_{x^{\prime}} \mid X=x\right]
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The challenge, thus, is to estimate the counterfactual expression <span class="math inline">\(E\left[Y_{x^{\prime}} \mid X=x\right]\)</span></p>
<div id="expressing-ett-in-terms-of-observational-data-and-experimental-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Expressing ETT in terms of observational data and experimental data</h3>
<p>Our treatment is binary. Therefore, let’s begin by using the law of total probability thus to write <span class="math inline">\(E[Y_x]\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E\left[Y_{x}\right]=E\left[Y_{x} \mid X=x\right] P(X=x)+E\left[Y_{x} \mid X=x^{\prime}\right] P\left(X=x^{\prime}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>We will use the consistency axiom: <span class="math inline">\(E[Y_x | X = x] = E[Y | X = x]\)</span>; that is, a counterfactual predicated on an actual observation is no counterfactual.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can re-write the above expression thus:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E\left[Y_{x}\right]=E[Y \mid X=x] P(X=x)+E\left[Y_{x} \mid X=x^{\prime}\right] P\left(X=x^{\prime}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>In the above expression there’s only one term that cannot be computed using observational data, <span class="math inline">\(E\left[Y_{x} \mid X=x^{\prime}\right]\)</span>: the same term that causes trouble in our ETT estimation. Let’s solve for it:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E\left[Y_{x} \mid X=x^{\prime}\right]=\frac{E\left[Y_{x&#39;}\right]-E[Y \mid X=x] P(X=x)}{P\left(X=x^{\prime}\right)} \\
E\left[Y_{x} \mid X=x^{\prime}\right]=\frac{E\left[Y | do(X = X&#39;)\right]-E[Y \mid X=x] P(X=x)}{P\left(X=x^{\prime}\right)}
\]</span></p>
<p>By plugging-in this term, we can express our ETT with terms that can be computed with a mix of observational and experimental data.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E T T &amp;=E\left[Y_{x}-Y_{x^{\prime}} \mid X=x\right] \\
&amp;=E[Y \mid X=x]-E\left[Y_{x^{\prime}} \mid X=x\right] \\
&amp;=E[Y \mid X=x]-\frac{E\left[Y \mid d o\left(X=x^{\prime}\right)\right]-E\left[Y \mid X=x^{\prime}\right] P\left(X=x^{\prime}\right)}{P(X=x)}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, if the treatment is binary, whenever the causal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be identified, the ETT can also be identified.</p>
</div>
<div id="going-back-to-joe" class="section level3">
<h3>Going back to Joe</h3>
<p>Let’s go back to our motivating example. We can express the ETT using the above derivation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E T T &amp;=E\left[Y_{1}-Y_{0} \mid X=1\right] \\
&amp;=E[Y \mid X=1]-E\left[Y_{0} \mid X=1\right] \\
&amp;=E[Y \mid X=1]-\frac{E[Y \mid d o(X=0)]-E[Y \mid X=0] P(X=0)}{P(X=1)}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, we can estimate the ETT with only observational data if we can estimate <span class="math inline">\(E[Y \mid d o(X=0)]\)</span> with observational data. Given that we know that we cannot estimate causal effects without making causal assumptions, let’s formulate ours.</p>
<p>Let’s say that our causal DAG for the effects of Smoking on Cancer is the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>example &lt;- dagify(x ~ u,
                  m ~ x,
                  y ~ u + m,
                  labels = c(&quot;x&quot; = &quot;Smoking&quot;,
                             &quot;y&quot; = &quot;Cancer&quot;,
                             &quot;m&quot; = &quot;Tar&quot;,
                             &quot;u&quot; = &quot;Genotype&quot;),
                  latent = &quot;u&quot;,
                  exposure = &quot;x&quot;,
                  outcome = &quot;y&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-08-16-causality-effect-of-treatment-on-the-treated_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Therefore, we can use the <a href="https://david-salazar.github.io/2020/07/30/causality-the-front-door-criterion/">front-door formula</a> to estimate the causal effect of smoking: <span class="math inline">\(E\left[Y \mid d o\left(X=x^{\prime}\right)\right]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, that we collect the following data:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mathpix.com/snip/images/6n3SO6qiX30qj9G6jSntJnaSnlZfjaUZv2rdgmlqxbk.rendered.fullsize.png" /></p>
<p>Then, using the front-door criterion, the causal effect <span class="math inline">\(E[Y \mid d o(X=0)]\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E[Y \mid d o(X=0)]=&amp; \sum_{z} P(Z=z \mid X=0) \sum_{x^{\prime}} P\left(Y=1 \mid X=x^{\prime}, Z=z\right) P\left(X=x^{\prime}\right) \\
=&amp; P(Z=1 \mid X=0)[P(Y=1 \mid X=1, Z=1) P(X=1)\\
&amp;+P(Y=1 \mid X=0, Z=1) P(X=0)] \\
&amp;+P(Z=0 \mid X=0)[P(Y=1 \mid X=1, Z=0) P(X=1)\\
&amp;+P(Y=1 \mid X=0, Z=0) P(X=0)] \\
=&amp; 20 / 400 *[0.15 * 0.5+0.95 * 0.5]+380 / 400 *[0.1 * 0.5+0.9 * 0.5] \\
=&amp; 0.5025
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, we can calculate the ETT for Joe:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E T T &amp;=E\left[Y_{1}-Y_{0} \mid X=1\right] \\
&amp;=E[Y \mid X=1]-E\left[Y_{0} \mid X=1\right] \\
&amp;=E[Y \mid X=1]-\frac{E[Y \mid d o(X=0)]-E[Y \mid X=0] P(X=0)}{P(X=1)} \\
&amp;=0.15-\frac{0.5025-0.9025 * 0.5}{0.5} \\
&amp;=0.0475&gt;0
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, given that <span class="math inline">\(ETT&gt;0\)</span>, <strong>by smoking Joe has increased his chances of suffering from Cancer</strong>. Thus, he <em>should</em> feel regret: the <em>causal effect</em> smoking has had <strong>in his life</strong> has been to increase his chances of suffering from cancer, relative to those chances in the hypothetical world where he never smoked in the first place.</p>

<div id="the-more-general-case" class="section level2">
<h2>The more general case</h2>
<p>Let’s say that our treatment is discrete, but not binary. Is the Effect of Treatment on the Treated (ETT) identifiable? <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2615">Pearl and Shipster</a> have given an answer to this question using <a href="https://david-salazar.github.io/2020/07/31/causality-testing-identifiability/"><strong>C-components</strong></a></p>
<div id="identifiability-using-c-components" class="section level3">
<h3>Identifiability using C-components</h3>
<p>Remember, two variables are assigned to the same c-component iff <em>they are connected by a bi-directed path</em>. The c-components themselves induce a factorization of the joint probability distribution in terms of <strong>c-factors</strong>: post-intervention distribution of the variables in
the respective c-component under an intervention on all the other variables.</p>
<p>Just as before the causal effect was identified when <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and its children are in different C-components (i.e., there’s no bi-directed path between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and its children that are also ancestors of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>), the <em>necessary counterfactual expression</em> to <strong>compute the ETT</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(P(Y_x = y|x&#39;)\)</span>, <strong>is identifiable if and only if</strong> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and its children are in different C-components.</p>
<p>Indeed, whereas before (when we were trying to estimate the causal effect) we summed out <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from the <em>c-factor</em>, we now replace <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> <a href="(https://david-salazar.github.io/2020/07/31/causality-testing-identifiability/)">from the c-factor and divide by <span class="math inline">\(P(x&#39;)\)</span></a>. Then, we take the decomposition induced by the c-factors and marginalize and condition on the appropriate variables to get the variable of interest.</p>
<p>That is, the same test is a sufficient test for causal effects identifiability and both a necessary and sufficient test for ETT identifiability.</p>
</div>
<div id="confirming-our-former-result" class="section level3">
<h3>Confirming our former result</h3>
<p>Let’s take our former example of the causal model of Smoking on Cancer. This time, we will use bi-directed paths to show that there’s an unobserved confounder:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>example &lt;- dagify(x ~~ y,
                  m ~ x,
                  y ~ m)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_dagitty(example, layout = &quot;nicely&quot;, seed = 2) %&gt;% 
  node_descendants(&quot;x&quot;) %&gt;% 
  mutate(linetype = if_else(direction == &quot;-&gt;&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;dashed&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend, edge_linetype = linetype, color = descendant)) +
  geom_dag_edges(aes(end_cap = ggraph::circle(10, &quot;mm&quot;))) +
  geom_dag_point() + 
  geom_dag_text(col = &quot;white&quot;) +
  labs(title = &quot;The ETT is identifiable!&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;Because there&#39;s no bi-directed path between x and m&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-08-16-causality-effect-of-treatment-on-the-treated_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has no bi-directed path to its child <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the counterfactual query <span class="math inline">\(P(Y_x = y | x&#39;)\)</span> is identifiable. Thus, the ETT is identifiable; confirming what we have done until now.</p>
<p>However, if it were not binary, we could derive an estimator for the ETT using the induced factorization by the c-components. First, we replace with <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> in the c-component where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(x, y | do(m)) = P(y|m, x&#39;) P(x&#39;)
\]</span></p>
<p>Whereas the other c-component is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(m| do(y, x)) = P(m| do(x)) = P(m|x)
\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the conditional distribution on <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span></p>
<p>Conditioning on <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> and marginalizing <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(y_x | x&#39;) = (\sum_z P(y| z, x&#39;) P(x&#39;) P(z | x))/(P(x&#39;))
\]</span></p>
<p>That is, we replace <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> in the c-component where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is, we condition on <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> by dividing the joint density and marginalize <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Thus, we derive the estimator for the ETT in this model by using the c-factors.</p>
</div>
<div id="not-identifiable" class="section level3">
<h3>Not identifiable</h3>
<p>Now let’s work with an example where the causal effect is identifiable, yet the <strong>counterfactual query <span class="math inline">\(P(Y_x = y | x&#39;)\)</span> is not</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>example_not &lt;- dagify(s ~~ y,

                      x ~ z,
                      z ~ s,
                      y ~ x
                      )</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_dagitty(example_not, layout = &quot;nicely&quot;, seed = 2) %&gt;% 
  mutate(linetype = if_else(direction == &quot;-&gt;&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;dashed&quot;)) %&gt;% 
    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend, edge_linetype = linetype)) +
  geom_dag_edges(aes(end_cap = ggraph::circle(10, &quot;mm&quot;))) +
  geom_dag_point() + 
  geom_dag_text(col = &quot;white&quot;) +
  labs(title = &quot;The ETT is not identifiable&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;X is connected by a bi-directed path with S&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="conclusions" class="section level1">
