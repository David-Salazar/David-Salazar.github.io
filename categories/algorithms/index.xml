      <description>Big Oh NotationFirst, let’s try to remember what problem we are actually trying to solve: compare the different runtime of different algorithms. We are not comparing them across time, but across number of some basic operations. And we care not about the time itself, but about the runtime growth as the input size also growths. Thus, we use asymptotic analysis.
\(O(n)\) can thus be described as: the runtime grows linearly as the input size increases.</description>

      <description>Recursion black magicWhile working through some HackerRank’s problems, I came across the following exercise:
Find the number of ways that a given integer, \(X\), can be expressed as the sum of the \(N^{th}\) powers of unique, natural numbers.
However, I could not inmediately come up with a compelling way to programatically enumerate and examine all the possible sequences of numbers to find the required solution. Thus, it’s good time as ever to refresh my knowledge about recursion and specically, backtracking.</description>
