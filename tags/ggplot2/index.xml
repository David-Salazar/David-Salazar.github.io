      <description>What is it? ggsupplyDemand is an R package that makes it extremely easy to plot basic supply and demands using ggplot2
library(ggsupplyDemand) create_supply_and_demand() %&amp;gt;% shift_demand(outwards = TRUE) %&amp;gt;% plot_supply_and_demand(consumer_surplus = TRUE)  Why? I needed to plot some basic supply and demand curves in R. Obviously, I thought of ggplot2. However, it is not that straightforward. The best resource I could find was this blogpost from Andrew Heiss. I recopilated most of his functions, created a simple API and put all the functions on an package.</description>
