      <description>The moody Mr. MarketAnybody who has even a dime on the stock market will eventually get dragged on following the daily (or even hourly) moves in the market. However, this is not only a stressful idea, but also a very ineffective one. Most days in the market won’t even bulge your final total return. In fact, final market return is mostly determined by a handful of days alone.</description>

      <description>What is it?ggsupplyDemand is an R package that makes it extremely easy to plot basic supply and demands using ggplot2
library(ggsupplyDemand)create_supply_and_demand() %&amp;gt;% shift_demand(outwards = TRUE) %&amp;gt;% plot_supply_and_demand(consumer_surplus = TRUE)Why?I needed to plot some basic supply and demand curves in R. Obviously, I thought of ggplot2. However, it is not that straightforward. The best resource I could find was this blogpost from Andrew Heiss. I recopilated most of his functions, created a simple API and put all the functions on an package.</description>
